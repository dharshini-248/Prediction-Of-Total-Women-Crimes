# Prediction-Of-Total-Women-Crimes
##ABOUT THR PROJECT
This project aims to evaluate the total crimes in India according to state wise crime rate based on the previous year data.
By applying the Machine learning techniques,we forecast the data with 95% accuracy based on the dataset collected from the government of India.
By predicting the upcoming crime rates in India ,we can reduce the crimes by making precautions according to crime rate in each states.

##Abstract
The crime rate is ever-growing and so is technology.We thought of combining them to produce the meaningful insights.The objective of this project is to find out which state has the highest crime rate and the crime which is committed. In our project we have used ARIMA Algorithm to predict the future crimes.We also validate the crime in different visualization using power BI and Data Studio .Our data set includes crime data in India over past 19 years.

##prediction of Women crimes
In India total crimes is increasing from 2001 to 2019.By applying Machine Learning Technique "ARIMA MODEL",we can achieve an effective results.
Using this data  we have predicted the total crime rate in India that is after from 2020 to 2050 with 95% confidence level
